In the project directory, you can run: JSON 

What is JSON used for?
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

## React
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

### Function and Class Components

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

Let’s recap what happens in this example:

We call root.render() with the <Welcome name="Sara" /> element.
React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.
Our Welcome component returns a <h1>Hello, Sara</h1> element as the result.
React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match 

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to root.render().

## JavaScript
 1. HTML to define the content of web pages

 2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

 3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
 
JavaScript functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, taking some form of input and returning an output.

To define a function, you must use the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ( ). Then you have to write the function logic between curly brackets { }
